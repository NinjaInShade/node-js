# Welcome to my online shop project (e-commerce).

## Live build: [...]

#### NOTE: Styling/Responsiveness was not the main focus, but backend inplementation. You may find one or two things that slightly overflow on smaller screen, but this isn't my priority. If i get time i may come back for this, but it's just not the reason i've made this project.

## This is an online store made with node that incorporates concepts and technologies like:

- MVC pattern.
- Templating engines.
- Using middleware functions.
- Dynamic routing.
- Using SQL and NOSQL databases and ORM's - MySQL (sequelize) and MongoDB (mongoose) => and connecting them to a node application.
- How to create and use models => A decent part of the project used OOP and storing data in a file. This helped me understand how databases work a bit better.
- Advanced models.
- Querying databases inside nodeJS.
- Reading documentation properly.
