# Welcome to my online shop project.

## This is an online store made with node that incorporates concepts and technologies like:

- MVC pattern.
- Templating engines.
- How to create and use models => A decent part of the project used OOP and storing data in a file. This helped me understand how databases work a bit better.
- Using middleware functions.
- Dynamic routing.
- Advanced models.
- Using SQL and NOSQL databases - MySQL and MongoDB => and connecting them to a node application.
- Querying databases inside nodeJS
